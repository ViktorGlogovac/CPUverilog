Workday 1: Sat 27, 2022
We met up on Saturday, to work on the lab 7. Started off fixing some of the errors that the TA pointed out. And started the lab 7 assignment. The work was done in person and each of the codes were written together.


Workday 2: Sun 20, 2022
On Sunday we met online to work on the lab 7. We joined the office hours and finished the lab together. Pengyu submitted the lab 6 and the shortly after some more work on the lab7 he submitted that as well.


We worked on the lab simultaneously together, so the work was divided evenly.
